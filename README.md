clang-refactor 
==============

This is a early attempt to write a refactor for c and c++ programs based on clang-modernize and oclint rules.

in order to get refactoring for c++ i started to implement some refactorings.
i can not garantee that these will not break your code.
my aim is to improve the refactorings so that the code will stay intact.
the refactor is intended to run stand alone and can be integrated into editors by very simple 
plugins. 

i already wrote a plugin for vim
